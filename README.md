## Description

The purpose of developing this webpage is to offer users a convenient platform for accessing, monitoring, and searching for anime that they may want to add to their personal list. This project successfully accomplishes two primary objectives: tracking and managing anime, and searching for anime quotes. The webpage is also responsive, allowing users to access their lists with different devices.

3. Implement a more flexible method to move anime items between lists: Enable users to easily move anime items from one list to another using a drag-and-drop functionality.
4. Add anime description boxes on hover: Display anime description boxes when users hover over the anime tiles in order to provide more information about each anime.
5. Import and export list data: Allow users to import and export their list data using text files for easy backup or sharing with others.
6. Add quick buttons for adding anime to lists: Include separate buttons on anime search results that allow users to quickly add items to specific lists, such as "plan to watch," "completed," or "currently watching."
